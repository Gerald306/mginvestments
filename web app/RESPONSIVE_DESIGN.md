# MG Investments - Responsive Design Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive responsive design implementation for the MG Investments Teacher Management System. The application is now fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Breakpoints
We use a mobile-first approach with the following breakpoints:

- **xs**: 320px (Extra small devices - phones)
- **sm**: 640px (Small devices - large phones)
- **md**: 768px (Medium devices - tablets)
- **lg**: 1024px (Large devices - laptops)
- **xl**: 1280px (Extra large devices - desktops)
- **2xl**: 1536px (2X large devices - large desktops)
